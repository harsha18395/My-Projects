Binary classification of normal walking and walking with handicap
- Gyroscopic and Accelerometer reading were recorded in .csv format by 139 subjects using smartphone for both normal and handicap walk(by placing stone 
on the footwear to imitate staggered walk)
- We had to just consider gyroscopic reading and predict the type of walk
- tasks involved preprocessing of data(segregation, noise filtering,normalizing) , 
	Neural network modeling( we used Recurrent neural network)
- Have not added data in github because of copyright and volume of the data
